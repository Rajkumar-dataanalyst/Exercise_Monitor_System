# 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise Monitoring System

The **Exercise Monitoring System** is an AI-powered web application built with **Streamlit**, **MongoDB**, and **MediaPipe**. Designed for fitness trainers and trainees, this system enables remote workout monitoring through real-time **pose detection**, group management, and task tracking.

Whether it's **Push-ups**, **Curls**, or other exercises, the system ensures accurate monitoring using camera-based posture recognition. Trainers can assign tasks to multiple groups, while trainees can perform exercises with live posture validation.
